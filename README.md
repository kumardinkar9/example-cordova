## Debugging
On Android, you can use the Chrome web debugger to debug while developing the app/plugin for Android. Open the following url in Chrome, and click on `inspect`. This will open the js console for the Cordova app, and `console.log` messages will be visible.
```
chrome://inspect/#devices
```

Similarly on iOS, the Safari web inspector can be used.

### HyperTrack config
The example app needs a HyperTrack publishable key. To get the key, sign up [here](https://www.hypertrack.com/). The HyperTrack documentation is at [docs.hypertrack.com](http://docs.hypertrack.io/) which covers useful entities.
